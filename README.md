# WeaponsGallery [in building]

This is an amazing re-make of my old project "weapons". Here you can see details and find much information about the most famous weapons in the history.

This new version the design is better and you have a pagination system, but the most amazing improvement is that now you have a simple content managment system (thanks to PHP andLaravel framework) to add/edit/delete new weapons!

You can see the detailed documentation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yK_EmeBUVJSfb3LvhitFLjsetcXE11oJ?usp=drive_link).
