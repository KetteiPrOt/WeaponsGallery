# WeaponsGallery

This is an amazing re-make of my old project "weapons". Here you can see details and find much information about the most famous weapons in the history.

This new version the design is better and you can create, edit, and delete your own weapons! (thanks to PHP and Laravel framework)

You can see the detailed documentation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yK_EmeBUVJSfb3LvhitFLjsetcXE11oJ?usp=drive_link).
